Build a BSP image
-------------------
The board support package (BSP) image build has software components for the Qualcomm device support and software features applicable to Qualcomm SoCs. This build includes a reference distribution configuration for the Qualcomm development kits. For more details, see `Qualcomm Linux metadata layers <https://docs.qualcomm.com/bundle/publicresource/topics/80-70020-27/qualcomm_bsp_metadata_layers.html>`__.

1. Download Qualcomm Yocto and the supporting layers. For the latest ``<manifest release tag>``, see the section *Build-Critical Release Tags* in the `Release Notes <https://docs.qualcomm.com/bundle/publicresource/topics/RNO-250630224842/>`__.

   .. container:: nohighlight
      
      ::

         # cd to directory where you have 300 GB of free storage space to create your workspaces
         mkdir <WORKSPACE_DIR>
         cd <WORKSPACE_DIR>
         repo init -u https://github.com/quic-yocto/qcom-manifest -b qcom-linux-scarthgap -m <manifest release tag>
         # Example, <manifest release tag> is qcom-6.6.97-QLI.1.6-Ver.1.1.xml
         repo sync

#. Set up the build environment:

   .. container:: nohighlight
      
      ::

         MACHINE=<machine> DISTRO=qcom-wayland QCOM_SELECTED_BSP=<override> source setup-environment
         # Example, MACHINE=qcs6490-rb3gen2-vision-kit DISTRO=qcom-wayland QCOM_SELECTED_BSP=custom source setup-environment
         # source setup-environment: Sets the environment, creates the build directory build-qcom-wayland,
         # and enters into build-qcom-wayland directory.

   For various ``<machine>`` and ``<override>`` combinations, see `Release Notes <https://docs.qualcomm.com/bundle/publicresource/topics/RNO-250630224842/>`__.

#. Build the software image. For supported image recipes, see :ref:`Image recipes supported in the GitHub workflow <image_recipes_github_workflow>`.

   .. container:: nohighlight
      
      ::

         bitbake <image recipe>
         # Example, bitbake qcom-multimedia-image

#. After a successful build, check that the ``system.img`` file is in the ``<workspace_path>/build-qcom-wayland/tmp-glibc/deploy/images/qcs6490-rb3gen2-vision-kit/qcom-multimedia-image`` directory:

   .. container:: nohighlight
      
      ::

         cd <workspace_path>/build-qcom-wayland/tmp-glibc/deploy/images/qcs6490-rb3gen2-vision-kit/qcom-multimedia-image
         ls -al system.img
