Use QSC Launcher
-------------------------

.. note::
  
    A one-time login is required into `chipcode.qti.qualcomm.com <http://chipcode.qti.qualcomm.com/>`__ to download Qualcomm proprietary git repositories. Use your Qualcomm login credentials to complete this step.

1. To open the QSC desktop application, either launch **Qualcomm Software Center** from the **Applications** menu or run the following command from the Linux terminal:

   ::

      /opt/qcom/softwarecenter/bin/softwarecenter

   .. note:: 
       For the Launcher workflow to detect connected devices and flash software builds, ensure that the Qualcomm Product Configuration Assistant Tool (PCAT) and Qualcomm USB Driver (QUD) are installed on the host machine. Click **PCAT** to install PCAT and **QUD** to install QUD as shown in the following image:

      .. image:: ../../media/k2c-qli-build-ga/QSC_has_PCAT_QUD_install_info.png

      **Or**

      Install PCAT and QUD using ``qpm-cli``:

      ::

         qpm-cli --login
         qpm-cli --install pcat --activate-default-license
         qpm-cli --install qud --activate-default-license

      The ``qpm-cli --help`` command lists the help options.

      For Ubuntu 22.04, you may encounter an issue while installing QUD where you are asked to enroll the public key on your Linux host for a successful QUD installation. For more details, follow the steps provided in the ``signReadme.txt`` file available at the ``/opt/QUIC/sign/`` directory.

2. Use your Qualcomm ID to log in to the QSC desktop application. A dashboard page appears as shown in the following figure:

   .. image:: ../../media/k2c-qli-build-ga/qsc_launcher_startLauncher.jpg

   -  If you do not have a connected device, click **Start Launcher** on the top panel to start the steps to configure, download, compile, and flash Qualcomm Linux to your device.
   -  If you have a connected device, click **Start Launcher** for the appropriate device in the **Connected devices** panel to download, compile, and flash Qualcomm Linux to your connected device.

3. On the **Specify Environment** page, select the following values based on the build:

   -  Category: **IoT**
   -  Chipset: **QCM6490**
   -  Host OS: **Linux**
   -  Target OS: **LE** 

   .. note:: See `Release Notes <https://docs.qualcomm.com/bundle/publicresource/topics/RNO-240911224732/>`__ for all the supported chipsets.

.. image:: ../../media/k2c-qli-build-ga/qsc_launcher_specifyEnvironment_v2.jpg

4. Click **Next**. The **Select Resources** page appears.

5. On the **Select Resources** page, perform the following steps:

   .. image:: ../../media/k2c-qli-build-ga/select_resources.png

   a. In the **Base Workspace Path** text box, specify a directory path where you want to download the software. You can click the select icon to display the directory selection window.

   b. Select product ID (For chipset QCM6490 and target OS LE,
      **QCM6490.LE.1.0** is the product ID).

   c. Select release ID (See the latest `Release Notes <https://docs.qualcomm.com/bundle/publicresource/topics/RNO-240911224732/>`__. For example, **r00218.1**).

   d. Select the appropriate distribution to download. Distribution access is controlled by access levels as listed in the following table:

        .. note::  
          For more details on the available distributions, see the **Access Controlled Distribution** table in the `Release Notes <https://docs.qualcomm.com/bundle/publicresource/topics/RNO-240911224732/>`__.

    The **Download** page displays the download progress. Download progress is also available in the top menu bar **Downloads** option in the Chip Software section.

.. _concept_n2t_tjn_w1c_step7:

7.  To start compilation after the download completes, select **Compile** (depending on the size of the downloaded software and host machine configuration, compilation may take a few hours):

    .. image:: ../../media/k2c-qli-build-ga/qsc_launcher_compile.png

8.  To view the compilation progress of individual software images, expand the logs panel as shown in the following figure:

    .. note::
      
       * ``<Base_Workspace_Path>`` is the path that you select on the **Select Resources** page.
       * BitBake fetch errors are typically intermittent fetch failures.
         Retry :ref:`step 7 <concept_n2t_tjn_w1c_step7>` to work around these intermittent errors. If the issue persists, see :ref:`BitBake Fetcher Error <do_fetch_error_1>` for a solution.

9.  To incorporate changes made after the compilation step is complete, click **Retry** to recompile:

Flash
^^^^^^^

.. note:: 
   Ensure that the device is in Emergency Download (EDL) mode
   before you flash the software. For more information on how to force the device into EDL mode, see :ref:`Move to EDL mode <section_vgg_mly_v1c>`.

To flash software to the device with Launcher, perform the following steps:

1. With the device connected and in EDL mode, select the device on which you want to flash the software as shown in the following figure:

   .. image:: ../../media/k2c-qli-build-ga/qsc_select_device_v2.jpg

2. Click **Flash on device**. The page updates and displays a progress bar as Launcher begins flashing the software. Leave the device connected while the software is being flashed.

3. To view logs, expand the logs panel as shown in the following figure:

   .. image:: ../../media/k2c-qli-build-ga/flash_launcher_logs.png

4. When the process is finished, *Flash Complete* and other similar messages are displayed on the page:

   .. image:: ../../media/k2c-qli-build-ga/flash_launcher_flashComplete.png

5. Click **Done**. To connect to the device, 
   see :ref:`How to SSH <section_hmw_vsh_p1c_vinayjk_03-01-24-1110-45-279>`.
