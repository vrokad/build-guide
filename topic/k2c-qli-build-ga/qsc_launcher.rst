   .. image:: ../../media/k2c-qli-build-ga/software_download_complete.png

   .. note:: Download progress is also available in the top menu bar **Downloads** option.

   Flashable binaries do not require compilation. If a flashable binary is selected, follow the onscreen prompts to flash to a connected device:

   .. image:: ../../media/k2c-qli-build-ga/prebuilt_compile.png

.. _launcher_build_default_config:

Build and flash default configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _launcher_step1:

1. Compile the default build.

   .. note:: For information on the default configurations, see the table *Default values of "MACHINE" and "QCOM_SELECTED_BSP" parameters for QSC* in the `Release Notes <https://docs.qualcomm.com/bundle/publicresource/topics/RNO-240929204440/>`__.

.. _launcher_compile_step:

   a. After the download is complete, select **Compile** to start compiling (depending on the size of the downloaded software and host machine configuration, the compilation process may take a few hours).

      .. image:: ../../media/k2c-qli-build-ga/download.png

   b. To view the compilation progress, expand the logs panel.

      .. image:: ../../media/k2c-qli-build-ga/QSC_compile_progress.png

   .. note:: BitBake fetch errors are typically intermittent fetch failures. To resolve these errors, retry :ref:`step 1a <launcher_compile_step>`. If the issue persists, see :ref:`BitBake Fetcher Error <do_fetch_error_1>` for a solution.

2. Flash with the default configuration.

   .. note:: Before you flash the software, ensure that the device is in Emergency Download (EDL) mode. For more information on how to force the device into EDL mode, see :ref:`Move to EDL mode <section_vgg_mly_v1c>`.

   a. Flash the software by selecting the device on which you want to flash the compiled software. If multiple devices are connected, select the correct target device:

      .. image:: ../../media/k2c-qli-build-ga/flash.png

   b. Click **Flash on device**. The page is updated and displays a progress bar as QSC Launcher begins flashing the software. Leave the device connected while the software is being flashed.

   c. To view the compilation progress of individual software images, expand the logs panel.

      .. image:: ../../media/k2c-qli-build-ga/flash_launcher_logs.png

   d. When the process is finished, *Flash Complete* is displayed on the page.

      .. image:: ../../media/k2c-qli-build-ga/flash_launcher_flashComplete.png

   e. Click **Done**.

      .. note:: The device reboots after the flashing procedure is completed successfully. To verify the updated software version, see `Check software version <https://docs.qualcomm.com/bundle/publicresource/topics/80-70015-253/ubuntu_host.html#sub$check_sw_version_uart>`__.
   
   f. To connect to the device, see :ref:`How to SSH <section_hmw_vsh_p1c_vinayjk_03-01-24-1110-45-279>`.

.. _launcher_build_own_config:

Build your own configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To build your own configuration, you must compile the build for default machine configuration and compile the LE.QCLINUX.1.0.r1 image with your own MACHINE and QCOM_SELECTED_BSP.

1. :ref:`Compile the build for default machine configuration <launcher_build_default_config>`.

2. Compile the `LE.QCLINUX.1.0.r1` image with your own MACHINE and QCOM_SELECTED_BSP.
   
   .. note:: For information on the supported machine configurations of the development kit, see the table *MACHINE and QCOM_SELECTED_BSP parameter value* in the `Release Notes <https://docs.qualcomm.com/bundle/publicresource/topics/RNO-240929204440/>`__.

   a. To execute the build commands for a specific configuration, click **Compile using terminal**:

      .. image:: ../../media/k2c-qli-build-ga/compile_terminal_page.png

      .. note:: Compilations executed through the terminal are not tracked by the Qualcomm Software Center and the ability to monitor their status on the Download page is lost.      

         .. image:: ../../media/k2c-qli-build-ga/compile_terminal_dialog.png
      
   b. Click **Open Terminal**. A terminal window with expanded default build command appears.

   c. Update the highlighted command with your own configuration and run it on the terminal:

      .. image:: ../../media/k2c-qli-build-ga/compile_terminal_new.png

      For example, to build for Qualcomm® RB3 Gen 2 Core Development Kit, update the ``MACHINE`` in the above build command to ``qcs6490-rb3gen2-core-kit``.
   
   d. After a successful build, check that the ``system.img`` is in the ``<Base Workspace Path>/DEV/LE.QCLINUX.1.0.r1/build-<DISTRO>/tmp-glibc/deploy/images/<MACHINE>/qcom-multimedia-image`` directory with updated timestamp. For example:

      ::

         cd <Base Workspace Path>/build-qcom-wayland/tmp-glibc/deploy/images/qcs6490-rb3gen2-core-kit/qcom-multimedia-image
         ls -al system.img
   
   .. note::      
      The compilation of any individual software images except ``LE.QCLINUX.1.0.r1`` must be followed by compiling the software product and ``LE.QCLINUX.1.0.r1`` in the same order.
 
      For example, if ``BOOT.MXF.1.0.c1`` is compiled, ensure to compile the software product (for example, QCM6490.LE.1.0) and ``LE.QCLINUX.1.0.r1``.

3. To flash your build, see :ref:`Flash images <flash_images>`.

   .. note::
      - Before flashing, ensure to have the build images path updated with the compiled build images workspace path ``<Base_Workspace_Path>/DEV/LE.QCLINUX.1.0.r1/build-<DISTRO>/tmp-glibc/deploy/images/<MACHINE>/qcom-multimedia-image``.

        For example, ``<Base Workspace Path>/build-qcom-wayland/tmp-glibc/deploy/images/qcs6490-rb3gen2-core-kit/qcom-multimedia-image``.

      - The device reboots after the flashing procedure is completed successfully. To verify the updated software version, see `Check software version <https://docs.qualcomm.com/bundle/publicresource/topics/80-70015-253/ubuntu_host.html#sub$check_sw_version_uart>`__.
      - To connect to the device, see :ref:`How to SSH <section_hmw_vsh_p1c_vinayjk_03-01-24-1110-45-279>`.
