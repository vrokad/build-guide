.. _flash_images:

Flash software images
======================

.. note:: Before flashing, update the build images path to the compiled build images workspace at ``<Base_Workspace_Path>/DEV/LE.QCLINUX.1.0.r1/build-<DISTRO>/tmp-glibc/deploy/images/<MACHINE>/qcom-multimedia-image``. For example, ``<Base Workspace Path>/build-qcom-wayland/tmp-glibc/deploy/images/qcs6490-rb3gen2-core-kit/qcom-multimedia-image``.

Follow these steps to flash the software images:

1. Update the ``udev`` rules (one-time prerequisite).
#. Force the device into emergency download (EDL) mode.
#. Provision UFS (one-time prerequisite).
#. Flash SAIL (one-time prerequisite).
#. Flash CDT.
#. Flash the software:

   - Using QDL
   - Using PCAT

.. _update_udev_rules:

Update ``udev`` rules (one-time prerequisite)
-----------------------------------------------

Configure the ``udev`` USB rules for the Qualcomm manufacturing vendor ID **05c6** on the Linux host:

1. Go to the ``udev`` USB rules directory:

   .. container:: nohighlight
      
      ::

         cd /etc/udev/rules.d

#. List the contents of the directory:

   .. container:: nohighlight
      
      ::

         ls

   -  If the ``51-qcom-usb.rules`` file isn't present, use the ``sudo vi 51-qcom-usb.rules`` file to create it and add the following content to the file:

      .. container:: nohighlight
      
         ::

            SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="05c6", ATTRS{idProduct}=="9008", MODE="0666", GROUP="plugdev"

   -  If the file exists, then check for the earlier content:

      .. container:: nohighlight
      
         ::

            cat 51-qcom-usb.rules

#. Restart ``udev``:

   .. container:: nohighlight
      
      ::

         sudo systemctl restart udev

#. If the USB cable is already connected to the host, unplug and reconnect the cable for the updated rules to take effect.

.. _move_to_EDL:

Force the device into EDL mode
--------------------------------

The device must be in the EDL mode before you flash the software. The Qualcomm supported device by default enters EDL mode if there is no image on the device after power up or if it's corrupted. To force the device into EDL mode, use any one of the following methods.

Use UART
^^^^^^^^^

Use UART only if the device has a preloaded build. This procedure applies to the Ubuntu host environment.

1. :ref:`Connect the device to a UART shell <connect_uart>`.

2. In the UART shell, move the device into EDL mode:

   .. container:: nohighlight
      
      ::

         reboot edl

3. Verify if the device is in EDL mode:

   .. container:: nohighlight
      
      ::

         lsusb

   If the output says QDL mode, the device is in EDL mode:
   
   .. container:: screenoutput

      .. line-block::

          Bus 002 Device 014: ID 05c6:9008 Qualcomm, Inc. Gobi Wireless Modem (QDL mode)

Use ADB
^^^^^^^^^

This procedure applies to the Ubuntu host environment. Use ADB only if the device has a preloaded build. 

1. `Install
   QUD <https://docs.qualcomm.com/bundle/publicresource/topics/80-70020-251/faqs.html#install-qud>`__
   on the host device.

2. `Install
   ADB <https://docs.qualcomm.com/bundle/publicresource/topics/80-70020-251/faqs.html#install-adb>`__
   on the host device.

3. `Connect
   ADB <https://docs.qualcomm.com/bundle/publicresource/topics/80-70020-251/faqs.html#install-adb>`__
   to the device.

4. Move the device into EDL mode in a terminal on the host computer:

   .. container:: nohighlight
      
      ::

         adb shell reboot edl

5. Verify if the device is in EDL mode:

   .. container:: nohighlight
      
      ::

         lsusb

   If the output says QDL mode, the device is in EDL mode:

   .. container:: screenoutput

      .. line-block::

          Bus 002 Device 014: ID 05c6:9008 Qualcomm, Inc. Gobi Wireless Modem (QDL mode)

.. _provision_ufs:

Provision UFS
---------------
Universal flash storage (UFS) provisioning helps to divide the storage into many LUNs, which stores different types of data separately. This improves access efficiency and system organization.

UFS is provisioned by default. If there are any changes in LUNs, UFS must be re-provisioned. To download the provision XML file and to check the applicability of UFS provisioning for different SoCs, see the table *UFS Provision* in `Release Specific Information <https://docs.qualcomm.com/bundle/publicresource/topics/RNO-250630224842/ReleaseNote.html#release-specific-information>`__.

1. Download the provision file.

   Based on the required SoC, download the respective ‘provision’ from the *UFS Provision* table of the `Release Notes <https://docs.qualcomm.com/bundle/publicresource/topics/RNO-250630224842/ReleaseNote.html#release-specific-information>`__.

.. _flash_cdt:

Flash CDT
----------
Configuration data table (CDT) provides platform/device-dependent data such as platform ID, subtype, version. Various Software (drivers/firmware) modules can use this information to perform dynamic detection and initialization of the platform. You can update CDT by flashing a CDT binary:

1. Download the CDT binary.

   Based on the required reference kit, download the respective CDT from the *CDT* table of the `Release Notes <https://docs.qualcomm.com/bundle/publicresource/topics/RNO-250630224842/ReleaseNote.html#release-specific-information>`__.

   .. container:: nohighlight

         <qdl_download_path>/qdl_<version>/QDL_Linux_x64/qdl --storage emmc prog_firehose_ddr.elf rawprogram*.xml patch*.xml

   .. note:: Use QDL binary based on the host computer architecture. For example, linux_x64 supported qdl binary is ``qdl_<version>/QDL_Linux_x64/qdl``.

Flash software using QDL
------------------------------------

1. Ensure that the ModemManager tool isn't running.

   Some Linux distributions include the ModemManager tool, which allows you to configure the mobile broadband. When you connect the device in the USB mode, it's identified as a Qualcomm modem, and the ModemManager tries to configure the device. Because this interferes with the QDL flashing, you must disable the ModemManager before connecting your device.
   
   If you are using a Linux distribution with ``systemd``, stop the ModemManager tool using the following command:

   .. container:: nohighlight
      
      ::

         sudo systemctl stop ModemManager

   If you need the ModemManager, you can restart it after the flashing is complete.
  
#. Download the QDL tool. QDL is a software tool that communicates with Qualcomm USB devices to upload a flash loader and flash software images. Acquire the latest version of the QDL tool using one of the following methods:
   
   - Download the tool from https://softwarecenter.qualcomm.com/#/catalog/item/Qualcomm_Device_Loader and unzip the contents of the downloaded folder.
   - Run the following command to download and unzip using CLI:
     
     .. container:: nohighlight
      
      ::
     
        wget https://softwarecenter.qualcomm.com/api/download/software/tools/Qualcomm_Device_Loader/Windows/latest.zip
        unzip latest.zip

#. Run the following command to provide executable permission to QDL:

   .. container:: nohighlight
      
      ::
   
         chmod -R 777 <qdl_download_path>

#. Flash the images:

   .. container:: nohighlight
      
      ::

         # Built images are under <workspace_path>/build-<DISTRO>/tmp-glibc/deploy/images/<MACHINE>/<IMAGE>
