Unregistered users
------------------

Unregistered users can sync and build Qualcomm Linux using the :doc:`GitHub workflow for unregistered users <github_workflow_unregistered_users>`. Qualcomm provides firmware components to unregistered users exclusively as binary files.

.. _section_x3d_nqy_v1c:

Registered users
-----------------

Registered users can use any one of the following three methods to sync and build Qualcomm Linux. These methods use the Qualcomm Yocto layers and the supporting base Yocto layers. Registered users have source access to some of the firmware components and Qualcomm tools for building and downloading software.

   - For information about the build methods supported for various chip products, see the *Sync and build methods* table in the `Release Notes <https://docs.qualcomm.com/bundle/publicresource/topics/RNO-240929204440/ReleaseNote.html#github-workflow-related-release-tags->`__.
   - Prebuilt binaries along with Platform eSDK links are listed in the `Release Notes <https://docs.qualcomm.com/bundle/publicresource/topics/RNO-240929204440/ReleaseNote.html#prebuilt-flashable-images-along-with-esdk>`__.

     The Platform eSDK is an installer generated from the Qualcomm Linux software. It provides a complete Yocto environment that allows you to sync, modify, compile, and install applications and open-source plug-ins. For more information, see :ref:`How to download the Platform eSDK <section_imr_xc4_1cc_vinayjk_07-12-24-1513-38-780>`.
