Flash images
===============

Follow these steps to flash the software images:

1. Update the ``udev`` rules (one-time prerequisite).
#. Move the device to Emergency Download (EDL) mode.
#. Provision UFS.
#. Flash CDT.
#. Flash the software:

   - Using QDL
   - Using PCAT

.. _update_udev_rules:

Update ``udev`` rules
------------------------

Configure the ``udev`` USB rules for the Qualcomm manufacturing vendor ID **05c6** on the Linux host:

1. Navigate to the ``udev`` USB rules directory:

   ::

      cd /etc/udev/rules.d

2. List the contents of the directory:

   ::

      ls

   -  If the ``51-qcom-usb.rules`` file is not present, use the ``sudo vi 51-qcom-usb.rules`` file to create it and add the following content to the file:

      ::

        SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="05c6", ATTRS{idProduct}=="9008", MODE="0666", GROUP="plugdev"

   -  If the file exists, then check for the previous content:

      ::

        cat 51-qcom-usb.rules

3. Restart ``udev``:

   ::

     sudo systemctl restart udev

If the USB cable is already connected to the host, unplug and reconnect the cable for the updated rules to take effect.

.. _move_to_EDL:

Move to EDL mode
------------------

The device must be in the EDL mode before you flash the software. The Qualcomm supported device by default enters the EDL mode if there is no image on the device after power up or if it is corrupted. To force the device into the EDL mode, use any one of the following methods.

**Using UART**

.. note:: Use UART only if the device has a preloaded build.

1. :ref:`Connect the device to a UART shell <section_ags_ssh_p1c_vinayjk_03-01-24-1109-49-684>`.

2. Move the device to the EDL mode by running the following command on the UART shell:

   ::

      reboot edl

3. Verify if the device has entered the Qualcomm Download (QDL) mode by running the following command on the host machine:

   ::

      lsusb

         .. note:: Dip switch S5-4 must be turned off after the flashing is complete.

Provision UFS
---------------
Universal Flash Storage (UFS) provisioning helps to divide the storage into multiple LUNS allowing different types of data to be stored separately. This improves access efficiency and system organization.

.. note::
    - This procedure is available for registered users only.
    - UFS is provisioned by default. If there are any changes in LUNs, UFS re-provisioning must be done again. To download the provision XML file and to check the applicability of UFS provisioning for different SoCs, see *UFS Provisioning* table in `Release Specific Information <https://docs.qualcomm.com/bundle/publicresource/topics/RNO-240929204440/ReleaseNote.html#release-specific-information>`__.

Flash CDT
----------
.. note:: Ensure that the device is in :ref:`EDL mode <move_to_EDL>`.

CDT provides platform/device-dependent data such as platform ID, subtype, version. Various Software(drivers/firmware) modules can make use of this information to perform dynamic detection and initialization of the platform. You can update CDT by flashing a CDT binary:

1. Download the CDT binary.

   Based on the required reference kit, download the respective CDT from the “Flash CDT" table of the `Release Notes <https://docs.qualcomm.com/bundle/publicresource/topics/RNO-240929204440/ReleaseNote.html#release-specific-information>`__.

   ::

      wget <CDT_download_link>
      unzip <downloaded_zip_file>

   Example:

   ::

      mkdir <cdt_download_path>
      cd <cdt_download_path>
      wget https://artifacts.codelinaro.org/artifactory/codelinaro-le/Qualcomm_Linux/QCS6490/cdt/rb3gen2-core-kit.zip
      unzip rb3gen2-core-kit.zip

#. Download the QDL tool.

   QDL is a software tool that communicates with the Qualcomm USB devices to upload a flash loader and flash software images.

   ::

      mkdir <qdl_tool_path>
      cd <qdl_tool_path>
      curl -L  https://softwarecenter.qualcomm.com/api/download/software/tool/Qualcomm_Device_Loader/1.0.1/Windows/Qualcomm_Device_Loader.Core.1.0.1.Windows-AnyCPU.zip -o qdl_all.zip
      unzip qdl_all.zip

#. Flash the CDT:

   ::

      cd <cdt_download_path>
      <qdl_tool_path>/qdl_1.0.1/QDL_Linux_x64/qdl prog_firehose_ddr.elf rawprogram3.xml patch3.xml

   .. note:: Use QDL binary based on the host machine architecture. For example, linux_x64 supported qdl binary is ``qdl_1.0.1/QDL_Linux_x64/qdl``.

.. _section_byn_pdj_x1c:

Flash software using QDL
------------------------------------

1. Ensure that the ModemManager tool is not running.

   Some Linux distributions include the ModemManager tool, which allows you to configure the mobile broadband. When the device is connected in the USB mode, it is identified as a Qualcomm modem, and the ModemManager tries to configure the device. As this interferes with the QDL flashing, you must disable the ModemManager before connecting your device.
   
   If you are using a Linux distribution with ``systemd``, stop the ModemManager tool using the following command:

   ::

      sudo systemctl stop ModemManager

   If you need the ModemManager, you can restart it after the flashing is complete.
  
#. Download the QDL tool:

   Qualcomm Device Loader (QDL) is a software tool that communicates with Qualcomm USB devices to upload a flash loader and flash software images.

   a. Using GUI

      Download QDL tool from https://softwarecenter.qualcomm.com/#/catalog/item/Qualcomm_Device_Loader and unzip the contents of the downloaded folder.

   #. Using CLI

      ::

         mkdir <qdl_tool_path>
         cd <qdl_tool_path>
         curl -L https://softwarecenter.qualcomm.com/api/download/software/tool/Qualcomm_Device_Loader/1.0.1/Windows/Qualcomm_Device_Loader.Core.1.0.1.Windows-AnyCPU.zip -o qdl_all.zip
         unzip qdl_all.zip

#. Flash the images:

      # Built images are under <workspace_path>/build-<DISTRO>/tmp-glibc/deploy/images/<MACHINE>/<IMAGE>
      # build_path: For DISTRO=qcom-wayland, it is build-qcom-wayland. 
      #             For DISTRO=qcom-robotics-ros2-humble, it is build-qcom-robotics-ros2-humble
      # qdl <prog.mbn> [<program> <patch> ...]
      # Example: build_path is build-qcom-wayland
      cd <workspace_path>/build-qcom-wayland/tmp-glibc/deploy/images/qcs6490-rb3gen2-vision-kit/qcom-multimedia-image
      <qdl_tool_path>/qdl_1.0.1/QDL_Linux_x64/qdl prog_firehose_ddr.elf rawprogram*.xml patch*.xml

   .. note:: Use QDL binary based on the host machine architecture. For example, linux_x64 supported qdl binary is ``qdl_1.0.1/QDL_Linux_x64/qdl``.

   Flashing is successful if you see *partition 1 is now bootable* on the terminal window as shown in the following message:

   .. container:: screenoutput

      .. line-block::

         LOG: INFO: Calling handler for setbootablestoragedrive
